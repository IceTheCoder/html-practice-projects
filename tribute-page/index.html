      <h4>Founding Apple</h4>
        <p>
          Steve Jobs co-founded the Apple Computer Company on April 1st, 1976 with Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne as a bussiness partnership to develop and sell 
          Wozniak's Apple I personal computer, which he had finished in March 1976. Steve Wozniak initially hesitated to sell his computer, but eventually accepted 
          Steve Jobs's idea to market and sell Apple I. Their operations initially started in Steve Jobs's bedroom and later moved to the garage.

            12 days later, Ronald Wayne sold his 10% share of Apple for $800, 
          </a>
          which would've been

            worth 270 billion dollars in 2023.
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The two chose the name Apple after Jobs's time at the All One Farm Commune in Oregon, at the farm's apple orchard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Steve Jobs planned to sell bare printed circuit boards of the Apple I for $50 each 
          (<a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm" target="_blank">equivalent to $274 in late 2023</a>).
          To fund this effort, Steve Jobs sold his HP calculator and Steve Wozniak sold his Volkswagen van. Later that year, 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Terrell" target="_blank">Paul Teller</a> bought 50 fully assembled 
          Apple Is for $500 each and founded the first PC retailer shop in December 1975, being the first retailer to sell the Apple I. Eventually, 200 Apple Is were 
          produced in total.

      <h4>Early products and success</h4>
        <p>
          In April 1977, 1 year after Apple's founding, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak introduced the Apple II at the West Coast Computer Faire in San Francisco, 
          California, U.S. Apple II was primarily designed by Steve Wozniak, while Steve Jobs oversaw development of the computer's unusual case and Rod Holt,
          Apple employee #5, developed the unique power supply. While designing the Apple II, Jobs and Wozniak disagreed on the number of expansion slots: Jobs
          wanted 2, while Wozniak wanted 8. They eventually agreed on 8 slots. The Apple II became one of the first highly-successful microcomputers in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Steve Jobs's relationship with his girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan, quickly deteriorated as she got pregnant. Steve Jobs's denied paternity, though a DNA 
          test established him as the father of <b>Lisa</b> Brennan-Jobs, born May 17, 1978.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1978, at the age of 23, Steve Jobs was worth $1 million ($4.5 million in 2023). By 1980, age 25, his net worth grew to $250 million ($450 million in 
          1980)
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1983, Steve Jobs convinced John Sculley away from Pepsi-Cola to serve as CEO of Apple, telling him
          <quote>"Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared drinks, or do you want a chance to change the world?"</quote>.
