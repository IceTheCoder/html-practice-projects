    <p>Steve Jobs (24 February 1955 - 5 October 2011) was a genius American inventor, best known for co-founding Apple; he also co-founded Pixar and founded NeXT. 
    He was a pioneer of the computer revolution in the 1970s and '80s, along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a>.

      <h3>Founding Apple</h3>
        <p>
          Steve Jobs co-founded the Apple Computer Company on April 1st, 1976 with Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne as a bussiness partnership to develop and sell 
          Wozniak's Apple I personal computer, which he had finished in March 1976. Steve Wozniak initially hesitated to sell his computer, but eventually accepted 
          Steve Jobs's idea to market and sell Apple I. Their operations initially started in Steve Jobs's bedroom and later moved to the garage. 
          <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/02/why-ronald-wayne-sold-his-10-percent-stake-in-apple-for-800-dollars.html" target="_blank">
            12 days later, Ronald Wayne sold his 10% share of Apple for $800, 
          </a>
          which would've been 
          <a href="https://dailyinvestor.com/investing/17501/the-apple-co-founder-who-sold-his-10-share-for-800/" target="_blank">
            worth 270 billion dollars in 2023.
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The two chose the name Apple after Jobs's time at the All One Farm Commune in Oregon, at the farm's apple orchard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Steve Jobs planned to sell bare printed circuit boards of the Apple I for $50 each 
          (<a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm" target="_blank">equivalent to $274 in late 2023</a>).
          To fund this effort, Steve Jobs sold his HP calculator and Steve Wozniak sold his Volkswagen van. Later that year, 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Terrell" target="_blank">Paul Teller</a> bought 50 fully assembled 
          Apple Is for $500 each and founded the first PC retailer shop in December 1975, being the first retailer to sell the Apple I. Eventually, 200 Apple Is were 
          produced in total.

      <h3>Computer revolution</h3>
      <h4>Apple II and early success</h4>
        <p>
          In April 1977, 1 year after Apple's founding, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak introduced the Apple II, an 8-bit home computer, at the 
          West Coast Computer Faire in San Francisco, California, U.S. Apple II was primarily designed by Steve Wozniak, while Steve Jobs oversaw development of 
          the computer's unusual case and Rod Holt, Apple employee #5, developed the unique power supply. While designing the Apple II, Jobs and Wozniak disagreed 
          on the number of expansion slots: Jobs wanted 2, while Wozniak wanted 8. They eventually agreed on 8 slots. The Apple II became one of the first 
          highly-successful microcomputers in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
          Steve Jobs's relationship with his girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan, quickly deteriorated as she got pregnant. Steve Jobs's denied paternity, though a DNA 
          test established him as the father of <b>Lisa</b> Brennan-Jobs, born May 17, 1978.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1978, at the age of 23, Steve Jobs was worth $1 million ($4.5 million in 2023). By 1980, age 25, his net worth grew to $250 million ($450 million in 
          1980)
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1983, Steve Jobs convinced John Sculley away from Pepsi-Cola to serve as CEO of Apple, telling him
          <quote>"Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared drinks, or do you want a chance to change the world?"</quote>.

        <h4>Introduction of the Macintosh</h4>
          <p>
            In 1981, Jobs took over development of the Macintosh, which had been conceived by Jef Raskin (1943 - 2005), an early Apple employee. On 22 January 1984, 
            Steve Jobs aired the famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtvjbmoDx-I" target="_blank">1984 Macintosh ad</a>, ending with the words: 
            <quote>
              "On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like '1984'."
            </quote>
          </p>
          <p>
            Two days later, an emotional Steve Jobs introduced the Macintosh at Apple's annual shareholders meeting in Flint Auditorium at De Anza College, as the 
            audience cheered at the sight of the Macintosh's <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>, inspired by Lisa, released 1 year prior, 
            which in turn was inspired by Xerox's PARC mouse-driven GUI. The Macintosh also had text-to-speech abilities. The computer was widely acclaimed 
            by the media with strong initial sales, though its low performance and lack of software led to a rapid decline in sales in the second half of 1984.
          </p>

        <h4>Macintosh vs Apple II</h4>
          <p>
            Sculley and Jobs had differing views for Apple: Jobs favored a close architecture design, like the Macintosh, as an alternative to the IBM PC, while Sculley 
            favored open architecture, like the Apple II. Therefore, Apple operated like two differing companies under two different division. And although the 
            Apple II division provided 85% of the company's revenue, it went unmentioned in the 1985 annual meeting. Many left as a result, including Wozniak, 
            who remained honorary employee of Apple and maintained a lifelong friendship with Steve Jobs regardless.
          </p>

      <h3>Departure</h3>
       <p>
        By 1985, it became clear the Macintosh failed to defeat the IBM PC. This strengthened Sculley position within Apple. As a result both Jobs and Sculley 
        made plans to remove one another from the company. Jobs plan was leaked and eventually resigned on 17 September 1985, although the Board rejected his 
        first resignation. Five more senior employees left Apple and joined Jobs's new venture, <a href="#NeXT">NeXT</a>.
       </p>
      
      <h3>Return</h3>
        <p>
          In 1996, Apple was struggling for its survival that depended on the next OS they'd develop. After failing to buy 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Inc.">Be Inc.</a>, Apple finalised a deal with NeXT for $400 million in February 1997, bringing Steve Jobs back 
          to the company as the de facto chief. Then-CEO Gil Amelio (1943 -) was ousted in July 1997, and Steve Jobs became interim CEO on 16 September.
        </p>
        <p>
          In March 1998, Steve Jobs terminated several Apple projects, such as Newton (<abbr title="Personal Digital Asisstant">PDA</abbr>), Cyberdog 
          (Internet suite), and OpenDoc (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_document">Compound document framework</a>). Within a few months, 
          Apple employees developed a fear of Steve Jobs's 'summary executions'; although these terminations were rare, it only took few to provoke terror 
          across the company.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apple went on to develop Mac OS X, based on NeXTSTEP, and the iMac, going down the route of appealing designs and powerful branding.

      <h3>Jump into portable electronics</h3>
        <p>
          Apple subsequently branched out and entered the market of consumer electronics and music players with the introduction of the 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod">iPod</a> in 2001 and the 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Store">iTunes Store</a> in 2003. On 29 June 2007, Apple introduced the 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone">iPhone</a>, a revolutionary mobile phone, with a multi-touch display, iPod features, and internet 
          browsing, which forever reshaped the industry.
