      <h2>Apple</h2>
      <h3>Founding Apple</h3>
      <p>
        Steve Jobs co-founded the Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976 with Steve Wozniak, a former high school 
        friend, and Ronald Wayne as a bussiness partnership to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer, 
        which he had finished in March 1976. Steve Wozniak initially hesitated to sell his computer, but eventually 
        accepted Steve Jobs's idea to market and sell the Apple I. Their operations initially started in Steve Jobs's 
        bedroom and later moved to the garage. 
        <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/02/why-ronald-wayne-sold-his-10-percent-stake-in-apple-for-800-dollars.html" 
        target="_blank">
          12 days later, Ronald Wayne sold his 10% share of Apple for $800, 
        </a>
        which would've been

        target="_blank">
          worth 270 billion dollars in 2023.
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The two chose the name Apple after Jobs's time at the All One Farm Commune in Oregon, at the farm's apple orchard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Steve Jobs planned to sell bare printed circuit boards of the Apple I for $50 each 
        (<a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm" target="_blank">equivalent to $274 in late 2023</a>).
        To fund this effort, Steve Jobs sold his HP calculator and Steve Wozniak sold his Volkswagen van. Later that 
        year, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Terrell" target="_blank">Paul Teller</a> bought 50 fully 
        assembled Apple Is for $500 each and founded the first PC retailer shop in December 1975, being the first 
        retailer to sell the Apple I. Eventually, 200 Apple Is were produced in total.

          <h3>Computer revolution</h3>
          <h4>Apple II and early success</h4>
          <p>
            In April 1977, 1 year after Apple's founding, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak introduced the Apple II, an 8-bit
            home computer, at the West Coast Computer Faire in San Francisco, California, U.S. Apple II was primarily 
            designed by Steve Wozniak, while Steve Jobs oversaw development of the computer's unusual case, and 
            Rod Holt, Apple employee #5, developed the unique power supply. While designing the Apple II, Jobs and 
            Wozniak disagreed on the number of expansion slots: Jobs wanted 2, while Wozniak wanted 8. They eventually 
            agreed on 8 slots. The Apple II became one of the first highly-successful microcomputers in the world.
          </p>
          <h4>Apple Lisa</h4>
          <p>
            Steve Jobs's relationship with his girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan, quickly deteriorated as she got pregnant. 
            Steve Jobs denied paternity, though a DNA test established him as the father of <b>Lisa</b> Brennan-Jobs, 
            born May 17, 1978.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1978, at the age of 23, Steve Jobs was worth $1 million ($4.5 million in 2023). By 1980, age 25, his 
            net worth grew to $250 million ($450 million in 2022). Also starting from 1978, Apple developed the 
            <strong>Lisa</strong>, which was sold until the early 1980s. The Lisa sold poorly at a measly 100,000 units, 
            although it was the first <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> with a 
            <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> for bussiness users. Steve Jobs was forced out of the 
            Lisa project in 1982.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1983, Steve Jobs convinced John Sculley away from Pepsi-Cola to serve as CEO of Apple, telling him
            <quote>
              "Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared drinks, or do you want a chance to change 
              the world?"
            </quote>.
            The same year, the company made the quickest entry into the Fortune 500 list of America's top companies.
          </p>
          <h4>Introduction of the Macintosh</h4>
          <p>
            In 1981, Jobs took over development of the Macintosh, in the absence of Steve Wozniak who was recovering 
            from a 
            <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/465778/today-in-apple-history-steve-wozniak-in-plane-crash/" 
            target="_blank">
              traumatic plane accident
            </a>. 
            The Macintosh had been conceived by Jef Raskin (1943 - 2005), an early Apple employee. On 22 January 1984, 
            Steve Jobs aired the famous, $1.5 million, Ridley Scott 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtvjbmoDx-I" target="_blank">1984 Macintosh ad</a>, 
            featuring an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh as saving the humanity from IBM's 
            domination of the computer industry. It ended with the words: 
            <quote>
              "On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like '1984'."
            </quote>
          </p>
          <p>
            Two days later, an emotional Steve Jobs introduced the Macintosh at Apple's annual shareholders meeting in 
            Flint Auditorium at De Anza College, as the audience cheered at the sight of the Macintosh's 
            <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>, inspired by Lisa, released 1 year prior, which in turn 
            was inspired by Xerox's PARC mouse-driven GUI. The Macintosh also had text-to-speech abilities. The computer
            was widely acclaimed by the media with strong initial sales, though its low performance, lack of software, 
            and high price led to a rapid decline in sales in the second half of 1984.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Macintosh released as the first mass-market personal computer with a GUI and mouse.

      </section>
      <h4>Macintosh vs Apple II</h4>
      <p>
        Sculley and Jobs had differing views for Apple: Jobs favored a close architecture design, 
        like the Macintosh, as an alternative to the IBM PC, while Sculley favored open architecture, like the 
        Apple II. Therefore, Apple operated like two differing companies under two different divisions. And although
        the Apple II division provided 85% of the company's revenue, it went unmentioned in the 1985 annual meeting. 
        Many left as a result, including Wozniak, who remained honorary employee of Apple and maintained a lifelong 
        friendship with Steve Jobs regardless.
      </p>
      <h3>Departure</h3>
      <p>
        By 1985, it became clear the Macintosh failed to defeat the IBM PC. This strengthened Sculley's position within 
        Apple. As a result both Jobs and Sculley made plans to remove one another from the company. Jobs's plan was 
        leaked and he eventually resigned on 17 September 1985, although the Board had rejected his first resignation. 
        Five more senior employees left Apple and joined Jobs's new venture, <a href="#NeXT">NeXT</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Return and the iMac</h3>
      <p>
        In 1996, Apple was struggling for its survival that depended on the next 
        <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> they'd develop. After failing to buy 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Inc."  target="_blank">Be Inc.</a>, Apple finalised a deal with NeXT 
        for $400 million in February 1997, bringing Steve Jobs back to the company as the de facto chief. Then-CEO Gil 
        Amelio (1943 -) was ousted in July 1997, and Steve Jobs became interim CEO on 16 September. Jobs quickly 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpmeXkQ-uC4" target="_blank">set up an alliance with Apple's rival, Microsoft,</a> 
        scrapped the previous Mac-clone agreements, greatly simplified the product line, and engineered a successful 
        ad campagin, encouraging customers to 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_different" target="_blank"><quote>'think different'</quote></a> and buy Macs.
        He also refused to produce computers that ran Windows, Microsoft's OS, and he refused to spin off Apple as a 
        software-only company.
      </p>
      <p>
        In March 1998, Steve Jobs terminated several Apple projects, such as Newton 
        (<abbr title="Personal Digital Asisstant">PDA</abbr>), Cyberdog (Internet suite), and OpenDoc 
        (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_document" target="_blank">Compound document framework</a>). 
        Within a few months, Apple employees developed a fear of Steve Jobs's 'summary executions'; although these 
        terminations were rare, it only took few to provoke terror across the company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apple went on to develop Mac OS X, based on NeXTSTEP, and the iMac, going down the route of appealing designs
        and powerful branding.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the iMac G3 released on August 15, 1998, Apple boasted <quote>"the back of our computer looks better than 
        the front of anyone else's"</quote>. The design was intented to create a personal connection with the product,
        with elements such as the handle and the breathing effect when the iMac went to sleep. The release price was 
        $1,299 and the iMac featured forward-thinking changes, such as a lack of floppy disk drives and exclusive use 
        of USB for peripherals. By the end of 1998, the iMac became the U.S.'s best selling personal computer.

        Following his resignation from Apple in September 1985, Steve Jobs founded NeXT with $7 million. After a year, 
        he was running out of money. He sought venture funding, attracting the attention of billionare

      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, Steve Jobs held a lavish invitation-only gala launch event on 12 October 1988, launching the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT_Computer" target="_blank">NeXT computer</a>, the company's first and 
        flagship product, with an introductory price of $6,500 (equivalent to $16,100 in 2022). The NeXT computer 
        featured a Motorola 68030 25 MHz CPU, 8 MB of RAM, expandable to 64 MB, 256 MB of storage, and a MegaPixel 17" 
        monitor with a resolution of 1120x832, four-level grayscale.
      </p>
      <p>
        NeXT computers were designed for the education sector, but were price-restrictive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tim Bernes-Lee invented the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> in 1990 at 
        <abbr title="[FR] Conseil européen pour la Recherche nucléaire / [EN] European Organization for Nuclear Research">CERN</abbr> 
        in Switzerland on a NeXT computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The revised, more affordable, second generation of the NeXT computer was released in 1990. Jobs advertised it as
        the first &ldquo;interpersonal computer&rdquo;, claiming it would replace <abbr title="Personal Computers">PCs</abbr> 
        with its innovative email system, with the ability to share voice, image, graphics, and video. Regardless, the 
        second NeXT computer only sold 50,000 units and by 1993, NeXT completely switched to software. The next year, 
        the company reported its first yearly profit of $1.03 million.

        In 1986, Steve Jobs funded the spinout of the Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar) from Lucasfilm's computer 
        graphics division with $10 million. The first film produced by Pixar in partnership with Disney, Toy Story 
        (1995), credited Steve Jobs as executive producer.
