      <h2>Apple</h2>
      <h3>Founding Apple</h3>
      <p>
        Steve Jobs co-founded the Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976 with Steve Wozniak, a former high school 
        friend, and Ronald Wayne as a bussiness partnership to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer, 
        which he had finished in March 1976. Steve Wozniak initially hesitated to sell his computer, but eventually 
        accepted Steve Jobs's idea to market and sell the Apple I. Their operations initially started in Steve Jobs's 
        bedroom and later moved to the garage. 
        <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/02/why-ronald-wayne-sold-his-10-percent-stake-in-apple-for-800-dollars.html" 
        target="_blank">
          12 days later, Ronald Wayne sold his 10% share of Apple for $800, 
        </a>
        which would've been 
        <a href="https://dailyinvestor.com/investing/17501/the-apple-co-founder-who-sold-his-10-share-for-800/" 
        target="_blank">
          worth 270 billion dollars in 2023.
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The two chose the name Apple after Jobs's time at the All One Farm Commune in Oregon, at the farm's apple orchard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Steve Jobs planned to sell bare printed circuit boards of the Apple I for $50 each 
        (<a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm" target="_blank">equivalent to $274 in late 2023</a>).
        To fund this effort, Steve Jobs sold his HP calculator and Steve Wozniak sold his Volkswagen van. Later that 
        year, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Terrell" target="_blank">Paul Teller</a> bought 50 fully 
        assembled Apple Is for $500 each and founded the first PC retailer shop in December 1975, being the first 
        retailer to sell the Apple I. Eventually, 200 Apple Is were produced in total.
